#### Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

**1. What is Software Engineering and Why is it Important?**
   - Software engineering is the systematic approach to designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. It combines principles from engineering and computer science to create reliable, efficient, and user-friendly software. Its importance lies in enabling the technology industry to build scalable solutions for complex problems, improving productivity and innovation.

**2. Key Milestones in the Evolution of Software Engineering**
   - **1960s: Introduction of Structured Programming** – Aimed to make code more organized and understandable.
   - **1970s: Waterfall Model Development** – The first structured software development process that provided a sequential approach.
   - **2001: Agile Manifesto** – Introduced a flexible and collaborative approach to software development, focusing on adaptability and customer feedback.

**3. Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)**
   - **Requirement Analysis**: Gathering user needs and expectations.
   - **Design**: Planning the software’s architecture and user interface.
   - **Development**: Writing the code.
   - **Testing**: Verifying the software functions correctly.
   - **Deployment**: Releasing the software to users.
   - **Maintenance**: Fixing bugs and updating the software over time.

**4. Waterfall vs. Agile Methodologies**
   - **Waterfall**: A sequential model where each phase must be completed before the next begins. Suitable for projects with fixed requirements, like government contracts.
   - **Agile**: An iterative model focused on flexibility and regular feedback, allowing frequent adjustments. Ideal for projects with evolving requirements, like startups or mobile app development.

**5. Roles in a Software Engineering Team**
   - **Software Developer**: Codes the software and implements features.
   - **Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer**: Tests software to ensure it meets requirements and is free of bugs.
   - **Project Manager**: Oversees project timelines, budgets, and team coordination to ensure project success.

**6. Importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS)**
   - **IDEs** (e.g., Visual Studio, PyCharm): Provide tools for writing, testing, and debugging code efficiently in one place.
   - **VCS** (e.g., Git, SVN): Track code changes, allow collaboration, and maintain a history of modifications for easy rollback and accountability.

**7. Common Challenges in Software Engineering and Strategies to Overcome Them**
   - **Challenge**: Managing scope and requirements changes. **Strategy**: Use Agile practices to incorporate regular feedback.
   - **Challenge**: Debugging complex code. **Strategy**: Adopt pair programming and thorough testing practices.
   - **Challenge**: Time constraints. **Strategy**: Prioritize essential features and use iterative development.

**8. Types of Testing and Their Importance**
   - **Unit Testing**: Testing individual code units for functionality.
   - **Integration Testing**: Ensuring different modules work together.
   - **System Testing**: Testing the entire software in a real environment.
   - **Acceptance Testing**: Validating software meets user requirements.
   - These types are crucial for maintaining software quality, detecting bugs early, and ensuring a smooth user experience.

#### Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

**1. What is Prompt Engineering and Why is it Important?**
   - Prompt engineering is the craft of designing effective inputs (prompts) to interact with AI models. It is essential as it enables more accurate and useful AI responses, making interactions more efficient and relevant.

**2. Example of Improving a Prompt**
   - **Vague Prompt**: "Tell me about technology."
   - **Improved Prompt**: "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on job markets over the last five years."
   - **Why it’s More Effective**: The improved prompt is clear, specific, and provides context, helping the AI generate a focused, relevant response.
